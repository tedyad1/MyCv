            <p class="title">Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) when styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ?</p>
        

            <article>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, using relative sizes such as percentage, em, and rem has a huge advantage because it helps our website be seen more or less the same on different devices with different resolutions. For example, if we specify some dimension to be 50% then no matter what type of device we use it will only take half the user's screen. But, if we had used absolute measure measurement like 100px the space it takes would vary from device to device.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another reason why I think using relative sizes is important is in zooming. This is important because some people who visit a site may have difficulties in reading normal sized text. So, when they adjust the zoom in the setting, we do not want the structure of the website to be distorted or some content to be lost. The user should also not have to scroll vertically and horizontally to read text just because they have zoomed in. These problems would not arise if the website is made with relative sizes, which allows proper scaling of the site.

            <p class="title">We said 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px ? How does the browser interpret that ?</p>
        

            <article>
                <p>
                    By default the browser sets the default size to 16px. This means any texts that the programmer adds will have a font-size of 16px unless the they specifically change it to another value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When we say 200px it means that the text will be 12.5 times than the default 16px text. The browser will render the text to have a size that is 12.5 times the original text.

            <p class="title">Explain in detail(in technical terms) the specific changes in css3</p>
        

            <article>
                <p>
                    As with all programming languages CSS has been evolving since it's creation in 1996. It has changed quite a lot since then, and with CSS3 it has brought a lot of new features. Some of the major changes are described in detail below.
                </p>

                <p class="sub-heading">1. CSS3 is mobile focused</p>

                <p>
                    One of the major improvements in CSS3 is that it has become very mobile focused to make accessing webpages on a mobile device easier. With CSS3 it is recommended to focus on smaller devices when developing a website then making small changes to scale it to a larger device in the end.
                </p>

                <p class="sub-heading">2. CSS3 Colors</p>
                
                <p>
                    Before CSS3 the only available ways to apply colors were by Hexadecimal (#FE76CC or #FFF) and rgb() values. CSS3 has introduced three new ways of applying colors rgba(), hsl(), and specifing opacity values. rgba() adds on the existing rgb() mehtod where users add red, green, and blue values, so users can also add an alpha value from 0 - 1 to control the opacity of a color. The hsl() and hsla() are a new way of setting color by controlling the hue, saturation, and lightness, the hsla() adds an alpha value to control opacity.  Opacity is an another thing that is added in CSS3 which is a standalone property that user adds to control the opacity of an already created color.
                </p>

                <p class="sub-heading">3. Shadows</p>
               
                <p>
                    CSS3 has added the ability to create shadows in the webpages we build. There are two main ways we to add shadows in CSS3. They are Drop-shadow and Text-shadow. Drop-shadow uses the box model of CSS to apply shadow to the box of any element in the page. CSS3 allows us to control the color, blur, offset, and position of the shadow. Text-shadow on the other hand makes it possible to add shadow to any text on the page. We can adjust the offsets, blur radius and color of the shadow to be created.
                </p>

                <p class="sub-heading">4. Rounded corners</p>
                
                <p>
                    CSS3 provides the tools to add smooth curved edges in the boxes around element. This allows to create visually pleasing webpages instead of viewing boxes with 90 degree angles. In CSS3, we can apply this effect ny using the property border-radius and assigning values in px, %, or em. CSS3 also allows to create a border radius only on specific corners.
                </p>

                <p class="sub-heading">5. Configuring the scroll bar</p>

                <p>
                    Before CSS3 all webpages had the default browser's scroll bar and the programmer could not change it to match their website. With CSS3 we can now change the scroll bar to have a nice and consistent theme with our website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other small addition to CSS3 include the ability to add multiple backrounds, various types of gradients, some new selectors, and so on.
                </p>
